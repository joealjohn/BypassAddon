# Comprehensive ESP Bypass Module Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a comprehensive ESP bypass system for Minecraft that tricks servers into revealing underground blocks through sophisticated packet manipulation and position spoofing. The system consists of multiple coordinated modules designed to avoid detection by anti-cheat systems.

## Module Architecture

### 1. PositionSpoofer Module
**Purpose**: Spoofs player Y-position in movement packets to trick the server into revealing underground blocks.

**Key Features**:
- Spoofs Y-position to below Y=30 (configurable)
- Maintains camera position above ground
- Randomized offsets to avoid detection patterns
- Configurable spoof delays and Y-levels
- Anti-detection measures with movement validation

**Settings**:
- `spoof-y-level`: Target Y level for spoofing (default: 15.0)
- `randomize-offset`: Add random variations to avoid patterns
- `spoof-delay`: Delay between spoofed packets (5 ticks default)
- `maintain-camera`: Keep camera above ground while spoofing

### 2. FreecamBypass Module
**Purpose**: Allows camera movement without server detection for underground exploration.

**Key Features**:
- Detached camera movement from server position
- Smooth movement with acceleration/deceleration
- Packet suppression to avoid server detection
- NoClip mode for passing through blocks
- Ghost player rendering at server position

**Settings**:
- `speed`: Camera movement speed (1.0 default)
- `vertical-speed`: Vertical movement multiplier
- `suppress-movement-packets`: Prevent movement packet sending
- `packet-suppress-radius`: Distance threshold for packet suppression

### 3. ESPRenderer System
**Purpose**: Advanced ESP renderer for visualizing underground blocks with anti-xray bypass.

**Key Features**:
- Supports multiple block types (ores, storage, utility, spawners)
- Distance-based fading and priority rendering
- Y-level filtering for underground focus
- Exposure detection to show only hidden blocks
- Performance optimization with block caching

**Block Types Supported**:
- **Ores**: Diamond, Emerald, Ancient Debris, Gold, Iron, Redstone, Lapis
- **Storage**: Chests, Ender Chests, Shulker Boxes, Barrels
- **Utility**: Crafting Tables, Furnaces, Enchanting Tables
- **Special**: Mob Spawners, Lava sources

### 4. ChunkSniffer Component
**Purpose**: Processes chunk data efficiently to reveal and cache hidden blocks.

**Key Features**:
- Intercepts chunk data and block update packets
- Prioritized chunk processing based on distance
- Underground-focused scanning (below Y=16)
- Efficient block caching with age management
- Coordination with ESP renderer for block visualization

**Processing Features**:
- Configurable processing delays and block limits
- Priority scanning for nearby chunks
- Automatic cleanup of old data
- Performance optimization with threaded processing

### 5. BypassController Module
**Purpose**: Master controller that coordinates all bypass components for optimal results.

**Key Features**:
- Automatic module coordination based on player position
- Underground mode detection and activation
- Adaptive settings adjustment based on situation
- Safety delays between module activations
- Performance optimization across all modules

## Anti-Cheat Evasion Features

### Position Spoofing Evasion
- Randomized Y-position offsets to break detection patterns
- Gradual position changes instead of instant teleportation
- Realistic movement validation before packet spoofing
- Configurable delays to mimic human behavior

### Packet Manipulation Safety
- Movement packet suppression when camera is far from server position
- Realistic onGround flag spoofing based on target position
- Collision detection simulation for spoofed positions
- Anti-pattern randomization in packet timing

### Detection Avoidance
- Underground-only focus to avoid obvious surface cheating
- Distributed scanning patterns instead of grid-based
- Performance-aware rendering to avoid lag spikes
- Coordinated module activation with safety delays

## Configuration Guide

### Basic Setup
1. Enable `BypassController` for automatic coordination
2. Configure `PositionSpoofer` with appropriate Y-level for your server
3. Set `ESPRenderer` block types based on your needs
4. Adjust `ChunkSniffer` processing rate based on performance

### Advanced Configuration
1. **For Heavy Anti-Cheat Servers**:
   - Increase spoof delays in PositionSpoofer
   - Enable safety mode in BypassController
   - Reduce chunk processing rate in ChunkSniffer
   - Use conservative Y-levels (below 10)

2. **For Performance Optimization**:
   - Adjust render distance in ESPRenderer
   - Limit blocks per tick in ChunkSniffer
   - Enable adaptive settings in BypassController
   - Use distance-based fading

3. **For Maximum Detection**:
   - Enable all block types in ESPRenderer
   - Increase scan radius in ChunkSniffer
   - Lower minimum Y-level for deeper scanning
   - Enable continuous chunk scanning

## Usage Instructions

### Automatic Mode (Recommended)
1. Enable `BypassController`
2. Configure underground threshold (default: Y=32)
3. Modules will automatically activate when going underground

### Manual Mode
1. Enable `PositionSpoofer` to start packet spoofing
2. Enable `ESPRenderer` to visualize blocks
3. Enable `ChunkSniffer` for block discovery
4. Optionally enable `FreecamBypass` for exploration

### Best Practices
- Start with conservative settings and gradually increase
- Monitor server responses and adjust accordingly
- Use underground mode only when necessary
- Coordinate with teammates to avoid conflicts

## Technical Implementation Details

### Packet Manipulation
The system intercepts and modifies the following packets:
- `PlayerMoveC2SPacket` - For position spoofing
- `ChunkDataS2CPacket` - For chunk data processing
- `BlockUpdateS2SPacket` - For real-time block updates

### Block Detection Algorithm
1. Intercept chunk data packets
2. Scan for valuable block types
3. Check if blocks are hidden (underground/enclosed)
4. Cache block positions with timestamp
5. Render blocks with priority-based system

### Anti-Detection Measures
- Randomized timing patterns
- Realistic movement simulation
- Gradual setting changes
- Performance-aware operation
- Coordinated module activation

## Warnings

This implementation is designed for educational purposes and testing server security. Use responsibly and in accordance with server rules and local laws. The anti-cheat evasion features are specifically designed to avoid detection but may still be detectable by advanced systems.

## Module Dependencies

- Meteor Client framework
- Fabric API
- Minecraft 1.21.5 mappings
- Java 21+

## Performance Considerations

- Monitor memory usage with large render distances
- Adjust processing rates based on client performance
- Use conservative settings on slower systems
